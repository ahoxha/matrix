# matrix
Find the order of matrix multiplication to ensure the minimal number of operations.

<p>When multipying a chain of matrices, provided they all comply with the multiplication requiremends, the order in which the 
multiplication is performed produces different numbers of calculations. The <strong>matrix</strong> program can be used to find the order
that, if followed, produces the minimum number of operations, hence a cheaper route in terms of calculations.

It is an <i>eclipse</i> project, so you can import it into your workspace and run it right away. Feel free to modify it.
It comes as an Applet (MatrixApplet class). If you prefer, you also have the MatrixFrame class that runs as a desktop application.

<p><h3>Input sample</h3>
<i>Input</i>: 10,3,5,6 <br>
<i>Explanation</i>: it means that we are multiplying three matrices: M1, M2, M3, with the dimensions: M1 [10,3], M2 [3,5],
M3 [5,6].
